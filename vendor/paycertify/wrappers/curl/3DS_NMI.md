## 3DS – PayCertify 3DS wrapper and NMI integration

### Authentication, Card Enrollment and Payment Authentication Request

The initial steps to use our 3DS platform integrating with NMI transactions are the following from our [3DS – Platform agnostic version](../master/curl/3DS.md):

1. [Authenticate](../master/curl/3DS.md#authentication)
2. [Check the card enrollment](../master/curl/3DS.md#check-card-enrollment)
3. [Payment Authentication Request (PAREQ)](../master/curl/3DS.md#payment-authentication-request-pareq)

After those steps, you'll receive the CAVV, ECI and XID parameters which are necessary to create the NMI transaction.

In order to create a transaction with 3DS these fields also need to be sent:

- `eci` E-commerce indicator. **(this was obtained on the last step of 3DS)**
- `cavv` Cardholder authentication verification value. Format: base64 encoded **(this was obtained on the last step of 3DS)**
- `xid` Cardholder authentication transaction id. Format: base64 encoded **(this was obtained on the last step of 3DS)**
- `cardholder_auth` Set 3D Secure condition. Values: 'verified' or 'attempted' (check the table below to know wich value you must send).

|                 | Visa | Master | cardholder_auth       |
|-----------------|------|--------|-----------------------|
| **`eci` value** | 05   | 02     | `verified`            |
| **`eci` value** | 06   | 01     | `attempted`           |
| `null`          | 07   | 00     | Not registered in 3DS |

In words: If you got from 3DS an `eci` of 05 (for Visa) or 02 (for Mastercard), you should set the `cardholder_auth` as 
`verified`. If you got from 3DS an `eci` of 06 (for Visa) or 01 (for Mastercard), you should set the `cardholder_auth` as 
`attempted`.
